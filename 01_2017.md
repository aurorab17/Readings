  reversible green fluorescenct protein cloned from Japanese eel called UnaG used to develop a reversible green fluorescent PCA  
  uPPI = UnaG-based PPI reporter  
  
  nUnaG was bound to Frb and FKBP was bound to cUnaG. The 'self-cleaving' peptide T2A separated the nUnaG-Frb from the FKBP-cUnaG. mCherry seems to have been coexpressed with a T2A peptide and served as a control. The authors suspect that there is low affinity between the nUnaG-Frb and FKBP-cUnaG, which is why in the absence of rapamycin, no fluorescence was observed (fluorescence for the mCherry was always observed). The fragment pairs fluoresced in the presence of rapamycin if the cleavage site was at 84/85. Fluorescence was not detected for the other cleavage sites tested, regardless of the presence of rapamycin. - need to read a bit more closely as to exactly what role the endogenous BR plays in this. Also, don't fully understand how they tested reversibility. They say that they added FK506, which inhibited te FKBP and Frb interaction.
  
  They used confocal microscopy to image. 488nm laser line was used to excite the Split-UnaG while a 561nm laser was used to excite the mCherry. The exposure times used were 2s and 500ms for Split-UnaG and mCherry, respectively. Mammalian cells were used (HEK293T/17 cells).  Bo Huang provided the group with the synthesized UnaG plasmid.

 surpassed the quantum noise limit on particle tracking utilizing squeezed light - demonstrate by tracking lipid granules in living S. cerevisiae (I didn't fully understand much of the article - would need to have a better understanding of [squeezed light](http://www.squeezed-light.de/), etc.)
