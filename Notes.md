"[Proteomic analysis (proteomics)](http://www.nature.com/subjects/proteomic-analysis) refers to the systematic identification and quantification of the complete complement of proteins 
(the proteome) of a biological system (cell, tissue, organ, biological fluid, or organism) at a specific point in time. 
Mass spectrometry is the technique most often used for proteomic analysis."  - Nature

[putative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/putative) - commonly accepted or supposed

[protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-fragment_complementation_assay) - method for identifying protein-protein interactions (PPI)

need to look a bit more into T2A - these are 'self-cleaving' peptides (see blog article on [multicistronic vectors](http://blog.addgene.org/plasmids-101-multicistronic-vectors) on addgene)
