 Will need to read this one again for specifics.  
 General idea of the system they introduce is neat though. From my understanding, they have 3 different entities:   
  1. target (fusion) protein + peptide tag
  2. fluorescent probe which is made up of a fluorophore + adaptor molecule (tag recognition site)
  3. non-fluorescent quenching molecule + short peptide (where the short peptide is similar to the peptide tag in the first bullet point so that it can be recognized by the fluorescent probe

 Now, if you have 2 and 3 mixed together in a system, then 2 can non-covalently (reversibly) bind to 3 (binding between the short peptide  and the adaptor molecule). When bound, there should be no fluorescence due to the fluorophore being quenched by the quencher. If 1 is also  included in the system, then the fluorophore in 2 will bind to the target protein's peptide tag in 1 and unbind from 3. Now away from the quencher, the fluorophore can emit light. Again, need to read for more details (e.g., binding affinities, etc.).
